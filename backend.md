# Backend Detailed Report

## Overview
The backend is built using **FastAPI (Python)**, providing RESTful endpoints for hospital resource and food waste optimization. It serves real-time data, analytics, and AI-driven recommendations to the frontend.

## Libraries & Technical Choices
- **FastAPI**: Chosen for its speed, async support, and automatic OpenAPI documentation. Compared to Flask or Django, FastAPI offers better performance and type safety.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Used for efficient data manipulation and analytics.
- **Scikit-learn**: Powers machine learning models for predictions (e.g., bed availability, patient routing).
- **Hugging Face Hub**: Hosts and loads pre-trained models for advanced AI tasks.
- **Pydantic**: Ensures robust data validation and serialization.
- **Custom ML Models**: Trained for hospital recommendation, occupancy prediction, and resource allocation.

## LLM Training Methods & Algorithms
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**: Used for time-series prediction of bed occupancy. Chosen for its accuracy and interpretability over alternatives like LSTM or ARIMA, which require more data and tuning.
- **Custom Classifiers (Scikit-learn)**: Used for hospital suitability scoring. Compared to deep learning, classical ML is faster and more explainable for tabular data.
- **Haversine Distance Calculation**: For geospatial routing and proximity analysis.
- **Simulated Real-Time Data**: Enables robust testing and demo scenarios.

### Why Not Other Techniques?
- **Deep Learning (LSTM, Transformers)**: Not used due to limited data and need for explainability. GBM and classical ML are more suitable for structured healthcare data.
- **ARIMA/Prophet**: Good for time-series, but less flexible for multi-feature hospital data.
- **Other Frameworks (Flask, Django)**: FastAPI’s async support and auto-docs are superior for modern APIs.

## Main Modules
- **hospital_allocation**: Handles hospital resource management, patient routing, dashboard stats, occupancy trends, specialty distribution, hospital and doctor data, and patient alerts.
- **waste-optimizer**: Manages food supply/waste optimization, inventory, demand, logistics, storage, farmer data, and AI-powered allocation plan generation.

## Endpoints
- **Hospital Resource Optimizer**
  - `/getDashboardStats`: Returns hospital dashboard statistics.
  - `/getOccupancyTrends`: Returns real-time bed occupancy data.
  - `/getSpecialtyDistribution`: Returns staff distribution by specialty.
  - `/getHospitals`: Returns hospital network details.
  - `/getDoctors`: Returns doctor details.
  - `/getPatients`: Returns patient alerts and emergency cases.
  - `/findHospital`: Returns recommended hospitals for a patient based on location and severity, using ML models and geospatial analysis.

- **Food Waste Optimizer**
  - `/getDashboardStats`: Returns food supply dashboard statistics.
  - `/getInventory`: Returns food bank inventory data.
  - `/getDemand`: Returns demand signals and requirements.
  - `/getLogistics`: Returns food distribution routes and logistics.
  - `/getStorage`: Returns storage and surplus data.
  - `/getFarmers`: Returns farmer and supplier data.
  - `/generatePlan`: Generates AI-powered allocation plans based on surplus, demand, and priorities.

## Data Flow
- **Request Handling**: Endpoints accept JSON payloads and return structured responses for frontend consumption.
- **Simulated/Real Data**: Data is either simulated or fetched from databases, depending on deployment.
- **AI/ML Integration**: Endpoints use machine learning models for predictions and recommendations.

## Scalability & Production Readiness
- **Modular Structure**: Each optimization module is independent, allowing easy addition of new features.
- **Cloud-Ready**: Can be containerized with Docker, deployed on Kubernetes, and scaled horizontally.
- **Database Integration**: Ready for integration with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or cloud databases for persistent storage.
- **Security**: FastAPI supports OAuth2, JWT, and other enterprise authentication methods.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Integrate with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for production monitoring.
- **Testing**: Pytest and FastAPI’s test client enable robust unit and integration tests.
- **Model Management**: Hugging Face Hub allows seamless updates and versioning of ML models.

## Extensibility
- Add new endpoints in the relevant module (`hospital_allocation/routes.py`, `waste-optimizer/routes.py`).
- Update response formats to match frontend requirements.
- Integrate new ML models or data sources as needed.
